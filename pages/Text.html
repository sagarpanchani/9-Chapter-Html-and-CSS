                            Hawking has sold over ten million copies

                                To create a paragraph, surround 
                                the words that make up the 
                                paragraph with an opening 
                                tag and closing <b class="colo-change">tag.</b> 
                                By default, a browser will show 
                                each paragraph on a new line 
                                with some space between it and 
                                any subsequent paragraphs.
                                Paragraphs A paragraph consists of one or more sentences 
                                 that form a self-contained unit of<i class="colo-change"> discourse.</i> The 
                                 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new 
                                 line. Text is easier to understand when it is split up 
                                 into units of text. For example, a book may have 
                                 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under 
                                 each heading there will be one or more 
                                 paragraphs. <br /><br><strong class="colo-change">Beware:</strong> Pickpockets operate in

                                    use this element just to indent a 
                                    piece of text — rather you should 
                                    achieve this effect using CSS.  </blockquote></p>
                                       The  element is used for
