        <h3>Choosing Images for  Your Site</h3>
        <p>Images can be used to set the 
          tone for a site in less time than 
          it takes to read a description. If 
          you do not have photographs 
          to use on your website, there 
          are companies who sell stock 
          images; these are images you 
          pay to use (there is a list of stock 
          photography websites below). 
          Remember that all images are 
          subject to copyright, and you 
          can get in trouble for simply 
          taking photographs from 
          another website.
          If you have a page that shows 
          several images (such as product 
          photographs or members of a 
          team) then putting them on a 
          simple, consistent background 
          helps them look better as 
          a group</p>

            As a website grows, keeping 
          images in a separate folder 
          helps you understand how the 
          site is organized. Here you can 
          see an example of the files for 
          a website; all of the images are 
          stored in a folder called images.
          On a big site you might like to 
          add subfolders inside the images
          folder. For example, images such 
          as logos and buttons might sit in 
          a folder <img src="../images/download.png" width="50" height="50px" alt="html images" align="right">called interface, product 
          photographs might sit in a page 
          called products, and images 
          related to news might live in a 
          folder called news.
          If you are using a content 
          management system or blogging 
          platform, there are usually tools 
          built into the admin site that 
          allow you to upload images, 
          and the program will probably 
          already have a separate folder 
          for image files and any 
          other uploads</p>
